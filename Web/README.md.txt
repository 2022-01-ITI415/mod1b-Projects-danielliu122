// game framework

This sample is intended to reverse the collecting pickups/apples
of Roll-a-ball and Apple Picker and use dodging objects instead. Instead of
the player earning points for collecting with objects they earn
points for constantly moving and not colliding with other objects. The
game framework is focused on the mechanics of player movement
and the boundary formality of avoiding other objects.
